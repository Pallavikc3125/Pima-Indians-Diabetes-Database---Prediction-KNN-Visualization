# Pima Indians Diabetes Database - Prediction & KNN-Visualization

Predict the onset of diabetes based on diagnostic measures

This training and test data from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. 
Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.
Libraries used:
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Seaborn
* Matplotlib.pyplot
* Sklearn
* Statsmodels

Used GridSearchCV, Hyperparameter tuning to increase the accuracy.
Prediction using KNN algorithm with 77% Receiver Operating Characteristic Accuracy.
